# Verification Modes

Each platform verifies BIOS files differently. `verify.py` replicates the native behavior
of each platform so that verification results match what the platform itself would report.


## Existence Mode

**Platforms**: RetroArch, Lakka, RetroPie

**Source**: RetroArch `core_info.c`, function `path_is_valid()`

The most straightforward mode. A file is OK if it exists at the expected path. No hash is checked.
Any file with the correct name passes, regardless of content.

| Condition | Status | Severity (required) | Severity (optional) |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| File present | OK | OK | OK |
| File missing | MISSING | WARNING | INFO |

RetroArch does not distinguish between a correct and an incorrect BIOS at the verification
level. A corrupt or wrong-region file still shows as present. This is by design in the
upstream code: `core_info.c` only calls `path_is_valid()` and does not open or hash the file.

Lakka and RetroPie inherit this behavior through platform config inheritance
(`inherits: retroarch` in the platform YAML).


## MD5 Mode

**Platforms**: Batocera, RetroBat, Recalbox, EmuDeck, RetroDECK, RomM

All MD5-mode platforms compute a hash of the file and compare it against an expected value.
The details vary by platform.

### Standard MD5 (Batocera, RetroBat)

`verify.py` replicates Batocera's `md5sum()` function. The file is read in binary mode,
hashed with MD5, and compared case-insensitively against the expected value.

| Condition | Status | Severity (required) | Severity (optional) |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Hash matches | OK | OK | OK |
| File present, hash differs | UNTESTED | WARNING | WARNING |
| File missing | MISSING | CRITICAL | WARNING |

If the `resolve_local_file` step already confirmed the MD5 match (status `md5_exact`),
`verify.py` skips re-hashing and returns OK directly.

### Truncated MD5 (Batocera bug)

Some entries in Batocera's system data contain 29-character MD5 strings instead of
the standard 32. This is a known upstream bug. `verify.py` handles it by prefix matching:
if the expected hash is shorter than 32 characters, the actual hash is compared against
only its first N characters.

### md5_composite (Recalbox ZIP verification)

Recalbox computes `Zip::Md5Composite` for ZIP files: the MD5 of the concatenation of all
inner file MD5s (sorted by filename). `verify.py` replicates this with `md5_composite()`
from `common.py`. When a ZIP file's direct MD5 does not match, the composite is tried
before reporting a mismatch.

### Multi-hash (Recalbox)

Recalbox allows comma-separated MD5 values for a single file entry, accepting any one
of them as valid. `verify.py` splits on commas and tries each hash. A match against any
listed hash is OK.

### Mandatory levels (Recalbox)

Recalbox uses three severity levels derived from two YAML fields (`mandatory` and
`hashMatchMandatory`):

| mandatory | hashMatchMandatory | Color  | verify.py mapping |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|-------------------|
| true      | true               | RED    | CRITICAL          |
| true      | false              | YELLOW | WARNING           |
| false     | (any)              | GREEN  | WARNING           |

### checkInsideZip (Batocera zippedFile)

When a platform entry has a `zipped_file` field, the expected MD5 is not the hash of the
ZIP container but of a specific ROM file inside the ZIP. `verify.py` replicates Batocera's
`checkInsideZip()`:

1. Open the ZIP.
2. Find the inner file by name (case-insensitive via `casefold()`).
3. Read its contents and compute MD5.
4. Compare against the expected hash.

If the inner file is not found inside the ZIP, the status is UNTESTED with a reason string.

### RomM verification

RomM uses MD5 verification (`verification_mode: md5`). The platform YAML stores
SHA1, MD5, and CRC32 for reference, but `verify.py` checks only the MD5 field,
matching the platform's runtime behavior. ZIP files are not opened; only the
container is checked.


## SHA1 Mode

**Platforms**: BizHawk

BizHawk firmware entries use SHA1 as the primary hash. `verify.py` computes SHA1
via `compute_hashes()` and compares case-insensitively.

| Condition | Status | Severity (required) | Severity (optional) |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| SHA1 matches | OK | OK | OK |
| File present, SHA1 differs | UNTESTED | WARNING | WARNING |
| File missing | MISSING | CRITICAL | WARNING |


## Emulator-Level Validation

Independent of platform verification mode, `verify.py` runs emulator-level validation
from `validation.py`. This layer uses data from emulator profiles (YAML files in
`emulators/`), which are source-verified against emulator code.

### Validation index

`_build_validation_index()` reads all emulator profiles and builds a per-filename
index of validation rules. When multiple emulators reference the same file, checks
are merged (union of all check types). Conflicting expected values are kept as sets
(e.g., multiple accepted CRC32 values for different ROM versions).

Each entry in the index tracks:

- `checks`: list of validation types (e.g., `["size", "crc32"]`)
- `sizes`: set of accepted exact sizes
- `min_size`, `max_size`: bounds when the code accepts a range
- `crc32`, `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`: sets of accepted hash values
- `adler32`: set of accepted Adler-32 values
- `crypto_only`: non-reproducible checks (see below)
- `per_emulator`: per-core detail with source references

### Check categories

Validation checks fall into two categories:

**Reproducible** (`_HASH_CHECKS`): `crc32`, `md5`, `sha1`, `adler32`. These can be
computed from the file alone. `verify.py` calculates hashes and compares against
accepted values from the index.

**Non-reproducible** (`_CRYPTO_CHECKS`): `signature`, `crypto`. These require
console-specific cryptographic keys (e.g., RSA-2048 for 3DS, AES-128-CBC for certain
firmware). `verify.py` reports these as informational but cannot verify them without
the keys. Size checks still apply if combined with crypto.

### Size validation

Three forms:

- **Exact size**: `size: 524288` with `validation: [size]`. File must be exactly this many bytes.
- **Range**: `min_size: 40`, `max_size: 131076` with `validation: [size]`. File size must fall within bounds.
- **Informational**: `size: 524288` without `validation: [size]`. The size is documented but the emulator does not check it at runtime.

### Complement to platform checks

Emulator validation runs after platform verification. When a file passes platform checks
(e.g., existence-mode OK) but fails emulator validation (e.g., wrong CRC32), the result
includes a `discrepancy` field:

```
file present (OK) but handy says size mismatch: got 256, accepted [512]
```

This catches cases where a file has the right name but wrong content, which existence-mode
platforms cannot detect.


## Severity Matrix

`compute_severity()` maps the combination of status, required flag, verification mode,
and HLE fallback to a severity level.

| Mode | Status | required | hle_fallback | Severity |
|------|--------|----------|--------------|----------|
| any | OK | any | any | OK |
| any | MISSING | any | true | INFO |
| existence | MISSING | true | false | WARNING |
| existence | MISSING | false | false | INFO |
| md5/sha1 | MISSING | true | false | CRITICAL |
| md5/sha1 | MISSING | false | false | WARNING |
| md5/sha1 | UNTESTED | any | false | WARNING |

**HLE fallback**: when an emulator profile marks a file with `hle_fallback: true`, the
core has a built-in high-level emulation path and functions without the file. Missing
files are downgraded to INFO regardless of platform mode or required status. The file
is still included in packs (better accuracy with the real BIOS), but its absence is not
actionable.


## File Resolution Chain

Before verification, each file entry is resolved to a local path by `resolve_local_file()`.
The function tries these steps in order, returning the first match:

| Step | Method | Returns | When it applies |
|------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 0 | Path suffix exact | `exact` | `dest_hint` matches `by_path_suffix` index (regional variants with same filename, e.g., `GC/USA/IPL.bin` vs `GC/EUR/IPL.bin`) |
| 1 | SHA1 exact | `exact` | SHA1 present in the file entry and found in database |
| 2 | MD5 direct lookup | `md5_exact` | MD5 present, not a `zipped_file` entry, name matches (prevents cross-contamination from unrelated files sharing an MD5) |
| 3 | Name/alias existence | `exact` | No MD5 in entry; any file with matching name or alias exists. Prefers primary over `.variants/` |
| 4 | Name + md5_composite/MD5 | `exact` or `hash_mismatch` | Name matches, checks md5_composite for ZIPs and direct MD5 per candidate. Falls back to hash_mismatch if name matches but no hash does |
| 5 | ZIP contents index | `zip_exact` | `zipped_file` with MD5; searches inner ROM MD5 across all ZIPs when name-based resolution failed |
| 6 | MAME clone fallback | `mame_clone` | File was deduped; resolves via canonical set name (up to 3 levels deep) |
| 7 | Data directory scan | `data_dir` | Searches `data/` caches by exact path then case-insensitive basename walk |
| 8 | Agnostic fallback | `agnostic_fallback` | File entry marked `agnostic: true`; matches any file under the system path prefix within the size constraints |

If no step matches, the result is `(None, "not_found")`.

The `hash_mismatch` status at step 4 means a file with the right name exists but its hash
does not match. This still resolves to a local path (the file is present), but verification
will report it as UNTESTED with a reason string showing the expected vs actual hash prefix.


## Discrepancy Detection

When platform verification passes but emulator validation fails, the file has a discrepancy.
This happens most often in existence-mode platforms where any file with the right name is
accepted.

### Variant search

`_find_best_variant()` searches for an alternative file in the repository that satisfies
both the platform MD5 requirement and emulator validation:

1. Look up all files with the same name in the `by_name` index.
2. Skip the current file (already known to fail validation).
3. For each candidate, check that its MD5 matches the platform expectation.
4. Run `check_file_validation()` against the candidate.
5. Return the first candidate that passes both checks.

The search covers files in `.variants/` (alternate hashes stored during deduplication).
If a better variant is found, the pack uses it instead of the primary file. If no variant
satisfies both constraints, the platform version is kept and the discrepancy is reported
in the verification output.

### Practical example

A `scph5501.bin` file passes Batocera MD5 verification (hash matches upstream declaration)
but fails the emulator profile's size check because the profile was verified against a
different revision. `_find_best_variant` scans `.variants/scph5501.bin.*` for a file
that matches both the Batocera MD5 and the emulator's size expectation. If found, the
variant is used in the pack. If not, the Batocera-verified file is kept and the discrepancy
is logged.
