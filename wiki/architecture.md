## Data flow

```
Upstream sources          Scrapers parse       generate_db.py scans
  System.dat (libretro)   + fetch versions     bios/ on disk
  batocera-systems                             builds database.json

  core-info .info files                         indexes: by_md5, by_name,
  FirmwareDatabase.cs                           by_crc32, by_sha256, by_path_suffix)

Pipeline runs all steps in sequence: DB, data dirs, MAME/FBNeo hashes,
verify, packs, install manifests, target manifests, consistency check,
pack integrity, README, site. See [tools](tools.md) for the full pipeline reference.

## Three layers of data

| Layer | Source | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| Platform YAML | Scraped from upstream | What the platform declares it needs |
| `_shared.yml` | Curated | Shared files across platforms, reflects actual behavior |
| Emulator profiles | Source-verified | What the code actually loads. Used for cross-reference and gap detection |

The pack combines platform baseline (layer 1) with core requirements (layer 3).
Neither too much (no files from unused cores) nor too few (no missing files for active cores).

The emulator's source code serves as ground truth for what files are needed,
what names they use, and what validation the emulator performs. Platform YAML
configs are scraped from upstream and are generally accurate, though they can
occasionally have gaps or stale entries. The emulator profiles complement the
platform data by documenting what the code actually loads. When the two disagree,
the profile takes precedence for pack generation: files the code needs are included
even if the platform does not declare them. Files the platform declares but no
profile references are kept as well (flagged during cross-reference), since the
upstream may cover cases not yet profiled.

    style PG fill:#2d333b,stroke:#adbac7,color:#adbac7
    style ZIP fill:#2d333b,stroke:#adbac7,color:#adbac7
```

## Pack grouping

Platforms that produce identical packs are grouped automatically.
RetroArch and Lakka share the same files and `base_destination` (`system/`),
so they produce one combined pack (`RetroArch_Lakka_BIOS_Pack.zip`).
RetroPie uses `BIOS/` as base path, so it gets a separate pack.
With `--target`, the fingerprint includes target cores so platforms
with different hardware filters get separate packs.

## Storage tiers

| Tier | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `embedded` (default) | file is in the `bios/` directory, included in packs |
| `external` | file has a `source_url`, downloaded at pack build time |
| `user_provided` | user must provide the file (instructions included in pack) |

## Verification severity

How missing or mismatched files are reported:

| Mode | required + missing | optional + missing | hash mismatch |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| existence | WARNING | INFO | N/A |
| md5 | CRITICAL | WARNING | UNTESTED |

Files with `hle_fallback: true` are downgraded to INFO when missing
(the emulator has a software fallback).

## Discrepancy detection

When a file passes platform verification (MD5 match) but fails
emulator-level validation (wrong CRC32, wrong size), a DISCREPANCY is reported.
The pack generator searches the repo for a variant that satisfies both.
If none exists, the platform version is kept.

## Security

- `safe_extract_zip()` prevents zip-slip path traversal attacks
- `deterministic_zip` rebuilds MAME ZIPs so same ROMs always produce the same hash
- `crypto_verify.py` and `sect233r1.py` verify 3DS RSA-2048 signatures and AES-128-CBC integrity
- ZIP inner ROM verification via `checkInsideZip()` replicates Batocera's behavior
- `md5_composite()` replicates Recalbox's composite ZIP hash

## Edge cases

| Case | Handling |
|------|---------|
| Batocera truncated MD5 (29 chars) | prefix match in resolution |
| `zippedFile` entries | MD5 is of the ROM inside the ZIP, not the ZIP itself |
| Regional variants (same filename) | `by_path_suffix` index disambiguates |
| MAME BIOS ZIPs | `contents` field documents inner structure |
| RPG Maker/ScummVM | excluded from dedup (NODEDUP) to preserve directory structure |
| `strip_components` in data dirs | flattens cache prefix to match expected path |
| case-insensitive dedup | prevents `font.rom` + `FONT.ROM` conflicts on Windows/macOS |
| frozen snapshot cores | `.info` may reflect current version while code is pinned to an old one. Only the frozen source at the pinned tag is reliable (e.g. desmume2015, mame2003) |

### File resolution chain

`resolve_local_file` in `common.py` tries each strategy in order, returning the
first match. Used by both `verify.py` and `generate_pack.py`.

```

## Platform inheritance

Platform configs support `inherits:` to share definitions.
Lakka inherits from RetroArch, RetroPie inherits from RetroArch with `base_destination: BIOS`.
`overrides:` allows child platforms to modify specific systems from the parent.

Core resolution (`resolve_platform_cores`) uses three strategies:

- `cores: all_libretro` - include all profiles with `libretro` in their type
- `cores: [list]` - include only named profiles
- `cores:` absent - fallback to system ID intersection between platform and profiles

## Hardware target filtering

`--target TARGET` filters packs and verification by hardware (e.g. `switch`, `rpi4`, `x86_64`).
Target configs are in `platforms/targets/`. Overrides in `_overrides.yml` add aliases and
adjust core lists per target. `filter_systems_by_target` excludes systems whose cores are
not available on the target. Without `--target`, all systems are included.

## MAME clone map

`_mame_clones.json` at repo root maps MAME clone ROM names to their canonical parent.
When a clone ZIP was deduplicated, `resolve_local_file` uses this map to find the canonical file.

## Install manifests

`generate_pack.py --manifest` produces JSON manifests in `install/` for each platform.
These contain file lists with SHA1 hashes, platform detection config, and standalone copy
instructions. `install/targets/` contains per-architecture core availability.
The cross-platform installer (`install.py`) uses these manifests to auto-detect the
user's platform, filter files by hardware target, and download with SHA1 verification.
