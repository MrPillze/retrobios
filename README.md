## How it works

Documentation and metadata can drift from what emulators actually load.
To keep packs accurate, each file is checked against the emulator's source code.

1. **Read emulator source code** - trace every file the code loads, its expected hash and size
2. **Cross-reference with platforms** - match against what each platform declares
3. **Build packs** - include baseline files plus what each platform's cores need
4. **Verify** - run platform-native checks and emulator-level validation
